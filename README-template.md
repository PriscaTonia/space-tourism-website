## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JSX
- CSS Flex
- CSS Media Queries - For responsiveness
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations


### What I learned

I decided to take on projects to work on and allocate a specific time to complete said project. 
I'm doing this for two reasons, firstly, to sharpen and build my skill, which is FRONTEND Development, and secondly, to improve my consistency to solving problems and creating solutions within a given time, hence the time range I gave myself. This project took approximately 14 days to complete, that's like 2 weeks. I picked the space tourism website because I really loved the designs and it looked really fun to work on. I was really excited. 
**Excited Meeh!**

Working on this website tested my skills on my ability to use CSS Flex for flexible arrangements of my elements on the DOM. It was a bit challenging. **PS: I think CSS was having PMC and being a bitch!** Also if you look closely on all the pages, except the home page, they all have TABs of designs. I enjoyed designing these tabs, their active and hover states too. Desiging tabs allowed me to practice mapping of arrays and objects to actually get the data I want and display it on the screen. I used a file to store all my data and then getting the data by mapping the arrays there to access the object properties. Well, thats how I did mine.

I also added some little animations and I used a library for that, Framer Motions. This was my first time adding animations to my work, and it was a bit >>>, yeah.

Making it responsive for other screens also gave me a bit of a struggle there. I noticed that trying to give specific widths for the media queries might not target all the necessary breakpoints, so I just decided to go with finding all the necessary breakpoints and fixing them up. In the End, I succeeded, Obviously. :).. Anyways, I had fun creating this and I have one more project added to my portfolio.**Peace Out**



### Continued development

Definitely gonna be learning more about animations and getting data from another file like JSON.

### Useful resources

- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - This helped me for my animations, because I don't know how to do them with pure CSS, I'll prolly learn in the future but this library is cool.
